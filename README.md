# Paul Knightly Photography Website

## Description

The client wanted to migrate their site from Wordpress to a static, hard-coded site hosted by GitHub Pages in order to eliminate recurring hosting fees. I started by coding a copy of their Wordpress site and, in doing so, decided to make some minor design changes. I also improved the overall site performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. See [Improvements](#improvements) for details.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

## Improvements
* Improved overall **Performance** on both mobile and desktop by 43% and 23%, respectively.
* Improved **Accessibility** on both mobile and desktop by 23%.
